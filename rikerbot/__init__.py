# if it doesn't come bursting out of you
# in spite of everything,
# don't do it.
# unless it comes unasked out of your
# heart and your mind and your mouth
# and your gut,
# don't do it.
# if you have to sit for hours
# staring at your computer screen
# or hunched over your
# typewriter
# searching for words,
# don't do it
#   - Charles Bukowski, so you want to be a writer?
