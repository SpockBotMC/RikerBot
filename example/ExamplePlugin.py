  # for the callback when registering a method for multiple events, but that
  # pattern is discouraged.
  # The data is dependent on the event, and might be `None` if no data is
  # provided by the event. For this example the data will be the
  # ClientboundChat packet.

  # !!!WARNING!!! Data is read-only, if you need to alter data, make a copy
  # of it first. This is due to how C++ plugins interact with the event system.
